# Landing Page — HTML & CSS Practice

This project is a landing page built as part of **The Odin Project – Foundations curriculum**.  
The goal was to practice core HTML and CSS skills including layout, styling, and responsive structure — without using JavaScript.

## Purpose

- Reinforce semantic HTML structure  
- Practice CSS layout techniques (Flexbox/Grid)  
- Improve styling consistency  
- Build a clean static landing page  

---

## Current Scope

This version focuses purely on **HTML and CSS**.  
No JavaScript functionality is included at this stage.

## Future Plans

I plan to revisit this project later to:

- Add JavaScript interactivity  
- Improve responsiveness  
- Refactor styles where needed  
- Enhance accessibility

## What I Learned

- Structuring pages with semantic HTML  
- Managing layouts with CSS  
- Styling reusable components  
- Organizing project files
